# Solar Suitability Score

## Description
This project calculates the solar suitability score for a specified geographical area using MODIS data and Landsat imagery. It analyzes various factors including NDVI, land cover suitability, slope, and solar radiation to assess the potential for solar energy generation.

## Features
- Calculates NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
- Analyzes land cover suitability based on MODIS data
- Computes solar radiation data
- Visualizes results on Google Earth Engine
- Exports the suitability score for further analysis

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/Tilakkumar13)/solar-suitability-score.git
